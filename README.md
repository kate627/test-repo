# test-repo
This is a test repo.

## Things to do:

1. create a new branch `documentation`.
2. change this README.md file to no longer have this text.
3. commit and push.
4. create a Pull Request against `master` and then merge it.
5. clean up local branch `documentation`. (hint `git branch -D ...`)
